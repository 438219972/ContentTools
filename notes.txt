Fixtures
--------

- What content will be returned in the modified dictionary because you'll often
  only want the inner contents - I think this is a sensible default to employ
  but we also need to consider options such as json output.
- How will re-reinstate a fixture, if we use the inner contents only then we
  need a way to revert the DOM element to it's state pre-editing (classes and
  potentially specialist data-ce-... tags). This could be built into the element
  classes on unmount.
- We need to implement changes to tools so that they respect the `can` method
  for ContentEdit element behaviours.
- Further to this we need to define some examples of customizing the toolbox
  based on a fixture/element with special rules.
